##### By default you just implicitly use the global runtime vars as datasource to render a template file.

This shows that you can use datakey and datapath to reference to a varname and a sub element of a var in global runtime scope


### How to use


* the datakey would be a plain text of a var name, or a dynamic templating value to pointing to a var name

* datapath:
  format is like a.b.c(name=fr*).value, following the yq path format:

  1. 'a.b.c'
  2. 'a.*.c'
  3. 'a.**.c'
  4. 'a.(child.subchild==co*).c'
  5. 'a.array[0].blah'
  6. 'a.array[*].blah'
