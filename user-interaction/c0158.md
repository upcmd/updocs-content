##### This shows how to externlise the exec profile


### How does it work


execution profile extend dev instance:

```
up ngo task -d ./tests/functests -t c0158 -p dev1_use_memcache --configdir=./tests/functests
```

You can use ref and redir to redirect the detailed env var key value pairs to another individual file if it turns out there are too many entries to be living in up.yml

* ref
  ref is the tag for refrencing to the file name to load

* refdir
  refdir is the tag for refrencing to the directory which the ref file is located.By default this would be the global refdir and you can leave it empty if the file is living in the same directory
